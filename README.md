# SoilTerra Dashboard

A smart agriculture monitoring system built with Next.js that provides real-time visualization of soil health parameters through an interactive dashboard. The system collects data from distributed IoT sensors via MQTT protocol, processes it, and presents actionable insights for better farming decisions.

## Key Features

- Real-time soil parameter monitoring (NPK, moisture, temperature)
- Interactive map view of sensor locations
- Smart predictions using advanced ML models:
  - Random Forest Regression with XGBoost for crop recommendations and irrigation scheduling
  - MobileNet-based image classification for:
    - Soil type identification
    - Plant disease detection
- Weather integration for environmental context
- Beautiful dark theme UI with responsive design
